## About

![](images/dkopta.JPG)

I'm an assistant professor, lecturer in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. Prior to that, I was a Senior OptiX Engineer at NVIDIA. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Utah under Dr. Erik Brunvand, where I focused on ray-traced computer graphics and GPU architecture.
